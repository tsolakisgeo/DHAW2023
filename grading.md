| Letter Grade | Points |  | Letter Grade | Points
| --- | --- |  | --- | --- |
| A+ | 97-100 |  | C+ | 76-79
| A | 93-96 |  | C | 73-76
| A- | 90-92 |  | C- | 70-73
| B+ | 87-89 |  | D+ | 67-69
| B | 83-86 |  | D | 64-66
| B- | 80-82 |  | D- | 60-63



## Attendance (9 points)

You will get 9 points for attending all twenty sections of the class. Special accommodations are possible in case of absence due to medical reasons or other emergencies. Contact the instructor in advance if you are going to miss a class.


## Participation (15 points)

Your participation in class discussions is a crucial element for succeeding in this course. Effective participation includes:
- Doing the readings in advance and joining the discussion in class.
- Talking and contributing to the day’s topic by participating in class activities, raising new ideas, supporting an argument, offering a different perspective to an expressed view, or proposing an alternative tool, method, or path for completing our tasks.
- Volunteering to present your weekly DH assignment.
Participation points are equally distributed among 16 sections of the class. This does not include the “Final Presentations” section. You will also get two “freebies,” that is two sections in which you can opt-out from participating without any impact on your participation grade.
If, for any reason, you cannot attend class, please notify me in advance. In cases where unforeseen circumstances (e.g., illness, family emergency) prohibit you from attending the class, you can make up the attendance and participation points for up to two absences by submitting an extra weekly response.


## Weekly responses (12 points)
From Week 2 to Week 9, students are asked to submit a response worth 2 points. Your weekly responses are twofold:
### 1. Response paper (1 points)
You must submit a response paper (min 80 words / max. 200 words) to one of the assigned articles. The paper is due before you arrive in class on the designated day. The aim of this assignment is for you to critically engaged with the assigned article. To do so effectively, make sure you are addressing:
1. What is the author’s thesis? 
2. What types of evidence are they using? 
3. What are their conclusions?
4. What is your reaction to their work? Do you think that the authors are achieving their goal?

### 2. Critique of two digital tools/websites (0.5 point)
For this assignment, you will have to choose two of the sites with which you have been asked to familiarize yourself. After you spend ~10 minutes on the website, grade it based on the following criteria:
- permanence and sustainability
- openness or restriction of their data
- functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
- connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  
For each of the above four criteria, give a grade (A = Excellent; B = Fairly well; C = Inadequate) and provide a short sentence explaining why (e.g., “Openness: C. I cannot extract and download my query in any format”). More information about this task and an example will be provided in the class meeting.


## Weekly assignments (24 points)
From Week 2 to Week 9, students are asked to submit an assignment (4 points x 6 weekly assignments). This assignment have the character of a short project and aims to help you monitor how well you can navigate and use the different software and digital methods introduced in the class. The assignment is due at 7am in the morning before the beginning of the first meeting each week.

## Weekly exercises  (16 points)
From Week 1 to Week 8, students are asked to submit an exercise (2 points x 8 weekly assignments) before the second meeting of the week. Weekly exercises have a similar aim to weekly assignments but are shorter in scope. Weekly exercises are due at 7am in the morning before the beginning of the second meeting each week.


## Note for Weekly assignments and Weekly exercises
When doing digital humanities tasks, it is expected that software will fail and computers will crash. Working with technology can often be unpredictable, so it is important for all of us to plan well ahead to anticipate any technical issues. Make sure that you are able to install the necessary software and do not wait until the night before class to start your assignment. Notify your instructor in advance for any technical problems you face relevant to your assignment. Feel free to email the instructor for any questions related to the project. If you are failing to complete the task, your questions should show that you have already put significant effort to your assignment and you are not simply looking for the right answer. Depending on the nature of your assignment project, you will be asked to submit to me by email or upload it on GitHub.

## Final Project (24 points)
With the help of the instructor, students will define and implement a final project that makes use of one or more of the methods and digital tools that were examined in this class. The final project will be submitted in lieu of final exams and will be supported by a 1000-word paper. The project must demonstrate:
- a clear research question 
- competence of the student in one or more relevant software
- thoughtful incorporation of course content
- quality of the project design and appearance

Projects that overlap with a student’s field of study are particularly welcome. You can find a rubric on the class online repository that explains how your final project will be graded. Depending on the nature of your final project, you may submit it to me by email or upload it on GitHub.
