Students are only allowed to use any AI tools, such as ChatGPT or Dall-E 2, in this course when they have the prior permission of the instructor. Purpose of this class is to acquire a set of skills related to Digital Humanities. The use of artificial intelligence programs to help you solve the assignment and excersices is like cutting corners on the great travel of college education. They will be a time that we will use AI tools together. Until then please have C. P. Cavafy's Ithaka (translated by Edmund Keeley) in mind:

___As you set out for Ithaka___

__hope your road is a long one,__

__full of adventure, full of discovery.__

_Laistrygonians, Cyclops,_

_angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:_

_you’ll never find things like that on your way_

_as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,_

_as long as a rare excitement_

_stirs your spirit and your body._

_Laistrygonians, Cyclops,_

_wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them_

_unless you bring them along inside your soul,_

_unless your soul sets them up in front of you._



_Hope your road is a long one._

_May there be many summer mornings when,_

_with what pleasure, what joy,_

_you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;_

_may you stop at Phoenician trading stations_

_to buy fine things,_

_mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,_

_sensual perfume of every kind—_

_as many sensual perfumes as you can;_

_and may you visit many Egyptian cities_

_to learn and go on learning from their scholars._



__Keep Ithaka always in your mind.__

__Arriving there is what you’re destined for.__

__But don’t hurry the journey at all.__

_Better if it lasts for years,_

_so you’re old by the time you reach the island,_

_wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,_

_not expecting Ithaka to make you rich._



_Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey._

_Without her you wouldn't have set out._

_She has nothing left to give you now._



_And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you._

_Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,_

_you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean._
