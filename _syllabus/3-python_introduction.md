## Assignments due: 

### Response Paper
- Based on today's reading, what's the difference a variable, a parameter, and an argument.

### Critique of two digital tools
- [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/home)
- [Orbis](https://orbis.stanford.edu/)

You can find instructions about this assignment [here](https://tsolakisgeo.github.io/DHAW2023/grading.html#2-critique-of-two-digital-toolswebsites-05-point).

##### Instructions
Upload your response paper and your digital tool critique on GitHub: Create an [.md file](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-8fb2e8ce24e3), paste your response paper, and push it to the directory `<username>/CLCV22123/3`. FYI, suppose there is no folder "3" in your subdirectories. In that case, you can either create a folder locally and push the changes with GitHub Desktop or create a new file on GitHub Online and type the `/` directory separator ahead of the name and extension for the new file.

### Weekly assignment
- Upload three files on GitHub:
    1. An HTML that is using at least five different elements aside from those that are given in HTML skeleton.
    2. A CSS with at least three selectors that is connected to the HTML. 
    3. An xml file with a text of your selection.


## Before Class 
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to use a variety of applications and programming languages. For the purposes of our class, we will focus on Python, one of the most popular (and easy to learn) programming languages. We will use Python through [Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd), an application that runs on your web browser and allows you to write, execute, visualize, and narrate your Python code. To install Anaconda and Python, follow the instructions of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Windows) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daVgEXjv6DE&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Mac). Please note that there are two parallel versions of Python: Python 3.x and Python 2.x. You should install the 3.x version (currently Python 3.10).
