## Before Class 
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to use a variety of applications and programming languages. For the purposes of our class, we will focus on Python, one of the most popular (and easy to learn) programming languages. We will use Python through [Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd), an application that runs on your web browser and allows you to write, execute, visualize, and narrate your Python code. To install Anaconda and Python, follow the instructions of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Windows) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daVgEXjv6DE&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Mac). Please note that there are two parallel versions of Python: Python 3.x and Python 2.x. You should install the 3.x version (currently Python 3.10).
