## Assignments due: 

### Response Paper:
Based on today's reading, what's the difference a variable, a parameter, and an argument.

### Critique of two digital tool
 - [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/home)
 - [Orbis](https://orbis.stanford.edu/)

You can find instructions about this assignment [here](https://tsolakisgeo.github.io/DHAW2023/grading.html#2-critique-of-two-digital-toolswebsites-05-point).

#### Instructions
Upload your response paper and your digital tool critique on GitHub: Create an [.md file](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-8fb2e8ce24e3), paste your response paper, and push it to the directory `CLCV25922/studenthub/<username>/2`, where username is the folder that you created in our first class. FYI there is no folder "2" in your subdirectories, but I am confident that you remember how to create it (hint: you can do it either locally and push the changes or from GitHub as we saw in the first class).

### Weekly assignment:
- Upload three files on GitHub:
    1. An HTML that is using at least five different elements aside from those that are given in HTML skeleton.
    2. An CSS with at least three selectors that is connected to the HTML. 
    3. An xml file with a text of your selection.


## Before Class 
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to use a variety of applications and programming languages. For the purposes of our class, we will focus on Python, one of the most popular (and easy to learn) programming languages. We will use Python through [Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd), an application that runs on your web browser and allows you to write, execute, visualize, and narrate your Python code. To install Anaconda and Python, follow the instructions of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Windows) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daVgEXjv6DE&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge) (if you are using Mac). Please note that there are two parallel versions of Python: Python 3.x and Python 2.x. You should install the 3.x version (currently Python 3.10).
