## HTML







## Assignment due: 
- Upload your response paper on GitHub: Create an [.md file](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-8fb2e8ce24e3), paste your response paper, and push it to the directory `CLCV25922/studenthub/<username>/3`, where username is the folder that you created in our first class. FYI there is no folder "3" in your subdirectories, but I am sure you remember how to create it (hint: you can do it either locally and push the changes or from GitHub as we saw in the first class).

## Before Class

## Notes
