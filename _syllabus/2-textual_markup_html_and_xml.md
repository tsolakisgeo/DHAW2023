## Assignment due: 

### Assignment 1 
- Create a new repository named "CLCV22323".
  
- Remember to add a README file.
  
- Click `Add file` and `Create new file`.
  
- You will get a field `Name your file`. Type there `1/firstassignment.md` (notice that I have a front slash immediately  followed by the file name. In this way I will create a folder and inside that folder I will create the file `firstassignment.md`).

- Press `Commit changes...` and again `Commit changes`.


### Assignment 2 
- Inside the folder you created above create a file named `favorite_passage.md` by following the instructions  above (Notice that in this case I am not using the `1/`).

- Copy into it a short passage (less than fifty words) from your favorite book.

- Make a change that your classmates can easily find. Example: “As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic elephant.” (Kafka's Gregor Samsa found himself transformed into a gigantic insect, not an elephant).

- Now go to the GitHub account of your assigned classmate. Find the mistake in their code and make a pull request.

- In order for this exercise to work, please all fix your classmate's quotes by 20:00 on Wednesday.

- On 20:00, go to your code. Accept your classmate's pull request (provided that they found the mistake). After you accept the pull request, write at the end of the file "Mistake fixed"
