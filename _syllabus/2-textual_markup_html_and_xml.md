## Assignment due: 

### Assignment 1 
- Create a new repository named "CLCV22323".
  
- Remember to add a README file.
  
- Click "Add file" and "Create new file"
  
- You will get a field `"Name your file"`. Type there `"1/firstassignment.md"` (notice that I have a front slash immediately  followed by the file name. In this way I will create a folder and inside that folder I will create the file firstassignment.md)


### Assignment 2 
- In the folder you created above create a file named `"favorite_passage.md"` (Notice that in this case I am not using the `"1/"`)

- Copy into it a short passage (less than fifty words) from your favorite book.

- Make a change that your classmates can easily find. Example: “As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic elephant.” (Kafka's Gregor Samsa found himself transformed into a gigantic insect, not an elephant).

- Now go to the GitHub account of your assigned classmate. Find the mistake in their code and make a pull request.

- In order for this excercise to work, please all fix your classmate's quotes by 20:00 on Wednesday.

- On 20:00, go to your code. Accept your classmate's pull request (provided that they found the mistake). After you accept the pull request, write at the end of the file "Mistake fixed"
