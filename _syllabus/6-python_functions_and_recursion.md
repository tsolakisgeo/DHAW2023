## Assignment due: 
- After you watch the last two videos in the Readings, expand on the advantages and disadvantages of using MS Excel (100 words).Upload your response paper on GitHub: Create an [.md file](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-8fb2e8ce24e3), paste your response paper, and push it to the directory `CLCV25922/studenthub/<username>/6`, where username is the folder that you created in our first class.

## Reading 
- Downey, A. B. (2015) _Think Python. How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_: Chapter 3 (Functions) and 5 (Conditionals and Recursion). Available [here](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf).
- Three videos by Matt Parker:
    1 [Stand-up comedy routine about Spreadsheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I).
