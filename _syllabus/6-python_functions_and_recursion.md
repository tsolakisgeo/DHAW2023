## Assignment due: 
- After you watch the last two videos in the Readings, expand on the advantages and disadvantages of using MS Excel (100 words).Upload your response paper on GitHub: Create an [.md file](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-readme-md-file-8fb2e8ce24e3), paste your response paper, and push it to the directory `<username>/CLCV22123/6`, where username is the folder that you created in our first class.

## Readings 
- Miller, B. N., Ranum, D. L. (2013) Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures. Release 3.0. [Link](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds3/Recursion/toctree.html)

## Notes
- More info about [Python format](https://pyformat.info/). But check now the [f-strings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/).
- On _recursion_, see three videos on Computerphile YouTube channel:
    1 .

    2. [Recursion 'Super Power' (in Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lhxIOAfDss&ab_channel=Computerphile).
    3. [Programming Loops vs Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXNhEYqFo0o&ab_channel=Computerphile)
- On _tail recursion_, see:
