## Assignment due: 
- Create a map. The places you choose may reflect a story you want to narrate (e.g., the Greco-Persian Wars), a topic of your interest (e.g., Athletic Games in Ancient World) or a modern topic. Upload your map on GitHub.

## Before Class 
- Download and install [QGIS Standalone Installer](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) (Long term release (most stable)) 

## Reading 
- Foote, K. E., Lynch, M. (1995) “Geographic Information Systems as an Integrating Technology: Context, Concepts, and Definitions, in The Geographer’s Craft <http://gisweb.massey.ac.nz/topic/webreferencesites/whatisgis/texaswhatisgis/texas/intro.htm>
- Tsiafakis, D., Evangelidis, V. (2006) “GIS as an Interpretative Tool in Greek Archaeological Research,” in G. Priestnall - P. Aplin (eds.) Proceedings of the GIS Research UK. 14th Annual Conference. GISRUK 2006. 5-7 April 2006, Nottingam: 328-333.

## Extra readings
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVuPAAAAoso&ab_channel=SarahE.Bond) on Pleiades and Antiquity À-la-carte by Tom Elliott and Sarah Bond (the video is a bit old so some features may have slightly changed).
- Use OpenRefine and Geocollider: [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a tool that helps you work with tabular data and  [Geocollider](https://pleiades.stoa.org/news/blog/introducing-geocollider) is a tool that helps you collate a list of places locations against the Pleiades gazetteer. See Tom Elliott, “[An example workflow for geography in an ancient studies project: the Vicarello cups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZZSVhQwXo&ab_channel=TomElliott),” who goes through step by step how you can form a text as a comma-separated values (CSV) file and how to use OpenRefine and Geocollider (after 17:08). Check also his blog post “[Using OpenRefine With Pleiades](http://horothesia.blogspot.com/2017/10/using-openrefine-with-pleiades.html),” in Horothesia, October 13, 2017.
