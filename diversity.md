“Diversity is critical to the process of discovery. Here, different backgrounds, viewpoints, and perspectives are not only sought after and encouraged, they are the building blocks that make rigorous inquiry possible” ([Diversity & Inclusion](https://diversityandinclusion.uchicago.edu/)). In this class, we will engage in discussion with empathy for all participants. I am committed to give equal opportunity for all students. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.
